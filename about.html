            <h2>What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
            <p>Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally new ways. Unlike classical computers that use bits as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.</p>
            <p>Quantum computing is being explored for applications in cryptography, optimization, and complex simulations, offering unprecedented computational power.</p>
